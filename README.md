## Install tmux

### preparation for tmux compilation on ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install -y autotools-dev
sudo apt-get install -y automake
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
```

tmux is a terminal multiplexer.
You will need to install tmux on the remote server and launch it automatically from
your .bashrc file


1. install tmux. Note that I wrote the tmux configuration files for tmux next-3.1
If you are working with tmux 2.x, you are going to get error messages that refer to my configuration files
I strongly recommend to download tmux source and compile it.
You will need to install tmux on your remote machine

1. After installing tmux, copy my tmux configuration file:
 `cp ~/dotfiles/tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf`

1. In order to use my script (``CTRL-b` `` `CTRL-bv` and `CTRL-bm`) make sure that you have python3.x and pstree.
 you can use yum to install those utilities

1. Add the following lines to your  ~/.bashrc file:
```
#make that the terminal is not in bracketed paste mode
printf "\e[?2004l"

if [[ -z "$TMUX" ]] && [ "$SSH_CONNECTION" != "" ]; then
    if [ -z "$DISPLAY" ]; then
        echo "X DISPLAY not available"
        sleep 3
    fi
    [ -f ~/.fzf.bash ] && source ~/.fzf.bash
    export session=$(tmux list-sessions -F "#{session_id}" | sort -n | tail -1 2>/dev/null)
    tmux new-session -s "ssh_tmux$session"
    exit
fi
```

1. Make sure that tmux is launched correctly, open and new terminal
and make sure that you see this:
![](tmux-home.png)

1. If you want to add smart title to your pane (for example to print a value of envirnment var)
you can set PS1 var in your .bashrc.
for example the following line will print the host name to the pane title:
`PS1="\[\033]2$PWD\033\033k$(hostname)\]$PS1"`

## Install neovim (nvim)
Install neovim (nvim) on the remote machine.
All my customization files for nvim are simple and should run even on old versions of nvim

to install neovim from ubunto repository:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install neovim
```

1. the following utilities are used by my nvim configuration so make sure that
those utilities are available or install them via yum:
 silversearcher-ag exuberant-ctags cscope global codesearch
 take a look at the function ZInstall in ~/dotfiles/nvim/init.vim

1. install neovim-remote (neovim nvr utility is required)

1. copy my nvim  confi files to your .config directory:
`cp -r ~/dotfiles/nvim ~/.config/`

1. open nvim and run:
`:PlugInstall`

1. exit and run nvim again:

1. you might want to change the line
`let g:linuxsty_patterns = [ "/kernel/", "/linux/"]`
this list holds a set of regular expression used to detect kernel code repository

## Install tmux-neovim customization scripts:

1. verify python version (python3.x is required):
`python --version`

1. Verify that python module "psutil" is installed:
`python -c "import psutil" && echo "psutil installed"`
